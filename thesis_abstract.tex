This thesis presents a phenomenological study of the production of \textit{WWZ} events through the inclusion of Anomalous Quartic Gauge Coupling (aQGC) operators. Triboson production studies can test the non-Abelian gauge structure of the Standard Model (SM); possible deviations from the SM predictions would provide hints of new physics at higher energy scales. In certain models with higher dimensional Effective Field Theory (EFT) operators, these couplings can be modified, leading to a significant enhancement of WWZ production cross section. Samples with these operators are generated and checked for deviations in the cross section with respect to SM predictions. The impact of aQGC operators for the production of \textit{WWZ} events is studied in the three lepton channel and discriminating observables are identified.
